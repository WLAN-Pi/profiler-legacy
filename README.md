# Profiler
A Python script to check wireless (802.11) capabilities based on association request frame contents. It has been developed to be specifically used with the WLAN Pi platform. 

The script performs two functions:

- Create a "fake" access point that will broadcast an SSID of your choosing
- As clients attempt to join the SSID broadcast by the fake AP, it will analyze the association frames generated by clients to determine their 802.11 capabilities.

Understanding client capabilities is an important aspect of Wireless LAN design. It helps a network designer understand the features that may enabled on a WLAN to optimize the design.

The capabilities supported by each client type may vary enormously, depending on factors such as the client wireless chipset, number of antennas, age of the client etc. Each client supplies details of its capabilities as it sends an 802.11 association frame to an access point. By capturing this frame, it is possible to decode and report on the client capabilities. On caveat, however, is that the client will match the capabilities advertised by an access point. For instance, if a 3 stream client detects that the acces point support only 2 streams, it will report that it (the client) only support 2 streams also. 

To get around this shortcoming, this script uses the Python FakeAP module to create a fake AP that advertises that it has the highest levels of feature set enabled. This fools the client in to revealing its full capabilities, which are then analyzed from the association frame that it uses as it attempts to join the fake AP. It then uses the Scapy module to capture and  analyze the association frames from each client to determine its capabilities.

A textual report is dumped in real-time to stdout and a text file copy is also dumped in to a directory of the WLANPi web directory to allow browsing of reports. In addition, a copy of the association frame is dumped in PCAP file format in to web directory. Each result is also added to a summary CSV report file that is created for each session when the script is run.

Report files are dumped in the following web directories for browsing:

- http://<wlanpi_ip_address>/profiler/clients (on directory per client, with PCAP and text capability report dumped in the directory)
- http://<wlanpi_ip_address>/profiler/reports (contains a CSV report of all clients for each session when the script is run)

## Installing the Script

(Note that the script is part of standard WLANPi image, so you will generally not need these instructions unless a new script version become available)

To install the script on the WLANPi perform the following steps:

- Download the profiler.py and config.ini file from the github repo: https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/profiler
- Open an SSH session to the WLANPi using the 'wlanpi' username, login and create a new directory (if required) using the command : mkdir profiler
- Change directory to the newly created directory: cd ./profiler
- Transfer the profiler.py script and config.ini files to the WLANPi (e.g. using SFTP)
- Make the script executable with "chmod a+x profiler.py"
- Ensure that a USB wireless adapter that support monitor mode (e.g. Comfast CF-912AC) is plugged in to the WLANPi

### MAC OUI Database Update

From version 0.03 of the script, a MAC OUI lookup is included in the reports to show the manufacturer of the client based on the 6-byte MAC OUI. This feature is provided by a Python module called "manuf". It uses a local MAC OUI database file to lookup OUI information. An OUI lookup file is provided with the module, though it may be quite old, depending on the date of the last update of the module code.

If you find some devices are not reporting a manufacturer, the OUI DB file may need an update. To update the manuf OUI DB file, perform the following steps from the CLI of the WLANPi:

- Ensure the WLANPi is connected to a network with Internet access
- SSH to the WLANPi
- Perform the following commands:

```
 cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/manuf
 python manuf.py --update
```

There are no outputs provided to indicate when/if the update has been successful, so I suggest only performing this step if absolutely necessary. If errors reported by the profiler script after running the update, try running the update again, as this operation seems a little "variable" in its sucess rate.

## Running the Script (CLI)

The script cab be run from the CLI of the WLANPi. To run the profiler, SSH to the WLANPi and run the script, for example:

```
 cd /home/wlanpi/profiler
 sudo ./profiler.py -c 36 (enter the root password when prompted)
```

The script will run continuously, listening for association requests, analyzing the client capabilities in realtime. To end the script, hit "Ctrl-c". Leave the script running while testing clients.

To trigger client profiling when the script is running:

- Fire up the client(s) to test
- Search for the SSID configured on the fake AP ("WLAN Pi" by default)
- Attempt to join the fake AP SSID from the test client
- When prompted, enter a random PSK on the client under test (any string of 8 or more characters will do)
- After a few seconds, a textual report will (hopefully) be displayed in SSH session already established to the WLAN Pi as it tries to associate. (Note that the client will not join the fake AP SSID.)
- Once clients have been tested and successfully triggered a client report, the captured association frame is dumped in to a PCAP file (browse to "http://<ip_address_of_wlanpi>/profiler" to see PCAP dumps and text reports)

## Running the Script (Front Panel Menu System)

From version v0.21 of the WLANPi FPMS, it is possible to launch the profiler script using the front panel keys of the WLANPi. The required option can be found at : Home -> 3.Apps -> 3.Profiler

Options are provided to start, stop and view the status of the profiler. Once the profiler has been started, the status option will show the channel, SSID and client count of detected clients. Operation is as per the CLI mode of operation described in the previous section, with reports being generated and visible from the WLANPi web GUI.

(Note: there is also an option to start the profiler with no 802.11r information elements being included in beacons. This will help with clients that are sensitive to 802.11r and will not attempt to associate when they see the 802.11r IEs)

### Configuration

To change the default operation of the script, for example to change the channel used), a "config.ini" can be found in the same directory as the profiler script (/home/wlanpi/profiler). By editing the parameters in this file, the operation of the fake AP created by the script may be modified. Note that if any changes are made, the profiler process will need to be stopped & started for the new settings to take effect. 

The configuration file may be updated by opening an SSH session to the WLANPi, then luanching the nano editor:

```
 nano /home/wlanpi/config.ini
```

Once changes have been made, hit Ctrl-X to exit the editor & save the changes.

## Usage

```
Usage:

    profiler.py [ -c <channel num> ] [ -s "SSID Name" ] [ -i interface_name ] [ --no11r ]
    profiler.py -h
    profiler.py -v
    profiler.py --help
    profiler.py --clean  (Clean out old CSV reports)
    
Command line options:

        -h       Shows help
        -c       Sets channel for fake AP
        -s       Sets name of fake AP SSID
        -i       Sets name of fake AP wireless interface on WLANPi
       --no11r   Disables 802.111r information elements
 
 ```
### Examples:

```
# capture frames on channel 48 using the default SSID
wlanpi@wlanpi:/home/wlanpi/profiler# sudo python ./profiler.py -c 48

```

```
# capture frames on channel 36 using an SSID called 'JOIN ME'
wlanpi@wlanpi:/home/wlanpi/profiler# sudo python ./profiler.py -c 36 -s "JOIN ME"

```

```
# capture frames on channel 100 using an SSID called 'Profiler' with 802.11r disabled for clients that don't like 11r
wlanpi@wlanpi:/home/wlanpi/profiler# sudo python ./profiler.py -c 100 -s "Profiler" --no11r
```

## Caveats
- Note that this is work in progress and is not guaranteed to report accurate info (despite our best efforts). **You have been warned**
- A client will generally only report the capabilities it has that match the network it associates to. If you want the client to report all of its capabilities, it **must** be associating with a network that supports those capabilities (e,g, a 3 stream client will not report it supports 3 streams if the AP is asscoiates with supports only one stream). The fake AP in this script attempts to provide a simulate a fully featured AP, but this is obviously a sumulated AP, so there may be cases when it does not behave as expected. 
- Reporting of 802.11k capabilities is very poor among clients I have tested - treat with extreme caution (check for neighbor report requests from a WLC/AP debug to be sure)
